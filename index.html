              <h2 class="blog-post-title">The Open Day</h2>
              <p class="blog-post-meta">September 8, by Kalki</p>
  
              <p>Open day was conducted as an effort to gain more interest among students and industries by exhibiting the college's rich knowledge on technical aspects by showcasing achievements and nurturing innovation.The management did get some visitors from outside and managed to pull off a good appearance in some areas. On the other hand, the day acted as an eye opener for a few departments to understand the areas they need to concentrate on.</p>
              <p>
              The clubs and student bodies showcased their achievements, history and motto at RLHC. We've got to give it to Photo society of MIT being the busiest bee on campus, covering the entire event. We've got to give it to some clubs who really sat down and got some time to rethink what their real motto is. On a completely different note, clubs just looked off vibe with the whole no performance rule.</p>
              <p>To sum it up, few might say that the departments stole the show with their projects and tech advancements and few might say that the clubs rocked it creating some interactive events. But deep down we all know that the math department really stole the show as there was an arrear at stake and that pushed their boundaries to make math look fun. yay! (it's not an overstatement).</p>
            <p>
              Finally my suggestion for all departments would be to nurture innovators and evaluate them through their interest towards the departmentp; clubs, to have an intent to make the campus more lively and the math department to not get offended by the article. 
              </p>
            <p>I would like to have an open day where we didn't have to prepare anything at all.<br>
            See ya.

              <h2 class="blog-post-title">The Readers’ Club of MIT</h2>
              <p class="blog-post-meta">September 8, by <span class="author">Naveenaa<span></p>
  
              <p>There is a popular saying, “We lose ourselves in books,we find ourselves there too.”
                It is true. Books really transport us to a different dimension. And reading a good book can help us understand the person we are.</p>

              <p>While our college has a number of clubs for various activities like singing,dramatics etc. There wasn’t a place for readers. And this pushed the need for us to begin with a Reader’s Club-more like a family of enthusiastic readers.</p>
              <p>
                The Readers’ Club was started under The Box Office club of MIT under the guidance of Dr. A.R.S.Jayanth. Our main objective is to encourage more and more readers to come up and share their thoughts and opinions about various genres and books and at the same time help people to inculcate the habit of reading.</p>
              <h2>What we're doing</h2>
         

                We aim to come up with many more fun and interesting sessions and activities that would motivate everyone in the college to develop the reading habit. </p>
                <p> To list down a few,the club plans to organize a book exchange programme where students with hardcopies or soft copies of books can exchange it with others who are in need of it. This will help to circulate books as well as keep all the members connected.
                Debate sessions where readers can argue about controversial books and characters will also be held. So, come join in!</p>
                </p>
